    <h2>Neural Networks: A Simple Explanation</h2>
    <p>Neural networks work similarly to the human brain, utilizing interconnected nodes (neurons) to process and interpret data. Just like our brain identifies objects through visual cues, neural networks learn from data patterns to perform tasks such as recognizing images or predicting outcomes.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Input Layer:</strong> Receives the initial data input.</li>
        <li><strong>Hidden Layers:</strong> Analyzes data patterns and refines understanding through adjustments.</li>
        <li><strong>Output Layer:</strong> Provides the final result or prediction.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Training involves repeatedly presenting examples and refining internal parameters (weights), allowing the model to improve over time, enhancing its accuracy and predictive capabilities.</p>

    <h2>Artifact 4: Communicating Neural Networks for Learning and Leadership</h2>  
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This artifact captures my contribution to a discussion activity focused on effective communication in change leadership, specifically in the context of AI/ML integration. The assignment challenged me to explain the concept of neural networks in simple terms‚Äîechoing Albert Einstein‚Äôs quote: <em>‚ÄúIf you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.‚Äù</em>
    </p>
  
    <h3>Visual Aid</h3>

    <h3>Rationale</h3>
    <p>
      I selected this artifact because it demonstrates two vital competencies: the ability to translate complex AI/ML concepts into accessible language, and the leadership communication strategies necessary to guide change within organizations. In this activity, I applied techniques like storytelling, multimodal communication, and active listening‚Äîprinciples drawn from our course materials.
    </p>
    <h3>Skills Demonstrated</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tailoring explanations for non-technical audiences</li>
      <li>Applying change communication models to AI/ML contexts</li>
      <li>Synthesizing learning concepts with leadership strategy</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Portfolio Relevance</h3>
    <p>
      This piece showcases how I approach AI/ML not only from a technical angle but also from a human-centered leadership perspective. It aligns with the broader goals of my portfolio‚Äîto bridge the gap between AI capabilities and effective implementation within regulatory and organizational frameworks.
